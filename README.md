### About Khayyam

Omar Khayyam (/kaɪˈjɑːm/ 18 May 1048 – 4 December 1131) was a Persian mathematician, astronomer, philosopher, and poet.
As a mathematician, he is most notable for his work on the classification and solution of cubic equations, 
where he provided geometric solutions by the intersection of conics.
Khayyam also contributed to the understanding of the parallel axiom.
As an astronomer, he designed the Jalali calendar, a solar calendar with a very precise 33-year intercalation cycle.
